# UPDATE FOR ENGINEERING IMMERSION PREP MENTORS 
Engineering Immersion Prep, also known as DEV-301-PREP, is managed a little differently than our other offerings. Please review this important information that will help you work with these students. 

For additional information on the technical evaluation, watch this [video recording](https://vimeo.com/282540579/44cfc94742) of Rich Greenhill & Kelly Kawa reviewing the [practice technical evaluation.](https://gist.github.com/rich-at-thinkful/730df07d682c3460e4cacb5f1701f0bc)  

## Mentor Objective
We are looking to the mentor for support in pushing your student through the Prep course material in order to make deadlines. The Prep course is designed to be difficult in order to measure student success in the Engineering Immersion program. As the mentor, you should feel empowered to advise your student on their potential success or failure in Engineering Immersion. Be honest with your concerns, if you have any. If you feel that your student should not take the Tech Eval or should enroll in our Full Stack Flex program instead, please slack the Program Manager so we can have a discussion about options with the student. 

*STUDENTS SHOULD ONLY TAKE THE TECH EVAL IF THEIR MENTOR ENDORSES THEIR ABILITIES!*


## Student Objective
Each student enrolled in this program is applying to  Engineering Immersion (EI), but must first pass this prep course that focuses on core concepts. This means that they are still technically Thinkful applicants. Prior to joining Prep, each student goes through an admissions process where we discuss their ability to commit 25-30 hours a week in Prep followed by 60 hours a week in EI. This is why it is important for mentors to push their students to complete their goals in a timely manner. Ideally, Prep students should take no longer than 3-5 weeks in the Prep course before they are ready to take their Technical Evaluation. 

Each studentâ€™s unique *Target Cohort Date* & *Tech Eval Deadline* is showcased on their dashboard. Mentors can see this as well. Note that some of your students may have different Tech Eval Deadlines. This could be because the student deferred their application for EI (meaning they have already been enrolled in Prep but are aiming to join a different cohort than their original target) or because the student and PM agreed on an earlier deadline to help keep them on track. 

In order to be accepted to Engineering Immersion, each Prep student must pass the Tech Eval as well as demonstrate an ability to manage their time and communicate professionally. 


## Prep Course Material
The following curriculum goals are required of each Prep student. These are also outlined on the student dashboard and broken down individually. There are detailed goal descriptions included with each goal that both students and mentors have access to. Please encourage your students to read these as many frequently asked questions are answered within the descriptions. I've included suggestions on how many mentor sessions should be spent on each in order to encourage your student to move through the curriculum. Feel free to adjust this based on your student's needs and background experience. 

  * Orientation Curriculum 
     no sessions
  * Unit 1 Web Dev Fundamentals - HTML/CSS
     1-2 sessions
  * Unit 2 Web Dev Fundamentals - Javascript
     2-3 sessions
  * Git/GitHub/Command Line
     1 session
     
     +1-2 sessions studying for the tech eval, reviewing material, practice eval. 
     =8 sessions in total
  
  NEW: Pre-Tech Eval Check-In With The Program Manager. This is required for all students who enrolled after July 20.

_Notice that Unit 3 Web Dev Fundamentals - jQuery is not included on this list. The student will have access to this unit but must skip this whole unit while in Prep._

  
## Mentor Sessions
Each Prep student receives a total of 8 1:1 mentor sessions (2x/week for 4 weeks) at 45-minutes each. This is also why it is important for Prep students to get through their goals in a timely manner. Any additional mentor sessions must be approved by the PM prior to them taking place. Mentors should encourage students to attend at least 1 Q&A session a week as well. Over 40 hours/week of Q&As are offered and are a great way for students to receive additional support. 

Submit a Session Note on the dashboard after each 1:1 session. Reach out to the PM if your student is a no-show and does not get in contact with you. Slack the PM if there is an urgent update about the student, otherwise we will use the session notes to stay updated.


## The Tech Evaluation
At the end of the program, each student will take a Tech Evaluation which will include an oral portion and 45 minutes of live coding. Students schedule the Tech Eval from their dashboard after all other goals have been completed and marked as approved. However, the student should not schedule their Tech Eval unless they are endorsed by you, the mentor. This means you should feel confident that your student is ready. You will meet with your students for a total of 8 sessions, or until they complete the Tech Eval, whichever comes first.

There is a [Practice Tech Eval](https://gist.github.com/rich-at-thinkful/730df07d682c3460e4cacb5f1701f0bc) you can conduct for your student as long as there are mentor sessions available to do so. Use that as a way to push your student through the material so they can plan accordingly. Students also have access to the [Study Guide](https://github.com/Thinkful-Ed/ei-prep-pub/blob/master/study-guide.md) availble from the student dashboard.

There is a Tech Eval and a Retake. Students can take each test only once while enrolled in Prep, regardless if they defer. This means they should schedule their first Tech Eval prior to the deadline to leave room for potentially taking the Retake for their original target chort. Otherwise, they can defer (if they have not already) and take the Retake for the following cohort. 


## Student Questions
If your student has questions about the following, direct them to the Program Manager (myself):

  * Wanting to update their Target Cohort or Tech Eval Deadline
  * Payment options & refunds (refunds are not available after being enrolled in Prep for 1 week)
  * Enrolling in another course
  * Withdrawing
  * Issues with accessing slack, their dashboard, etc. 
  * Anything else not related to curriculum



### No Longer Available or Interested in Mentoring for Prep?
Periodically Program Managers will reach out to mentors with available bandwidth about picking up a student. If you are unavailable, please update your bandwidth on your profile. If you would like to be removed from the EI Prep mentor list let [Angie Ellis](Angie.Ellis@thinkful.com) know asap.
